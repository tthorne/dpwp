Your application must have the following requirements:

    5 Data Objects (made from the same class) that will hold the data. These should be hard coded. No form or user input should be used for this assignment.
    These data objects should be made from the same class.
    There should be a minimum of 5 attributes.
    This class MUST have properties set up for at least 2 of the attributes/variables in the class and there should be at least one example of a getter and one of a setter.
    (The setter must be there, even though it will not actually be used by the rest of the code.)
    There should be a button (or link) for each item.
    When a button is clicked, your application should show the data for the object that button represents and use some of the data in a calculation.
    The results for that calculation should appear in the app as well.

Here's an example:

A grade average calculator. It holds the grade data for 5 students (Leonardo, Michael Angelo, Raphael, Donatello and Splinter). The application holds a "view" where the data will be seen and five buttons, one for each student. When the button labeled "Raphael" is clicked, his grade data appears in the view and likewise for the other students. In addition to his grades his GPA (calculated from his grades) is shown as well.

    You may not use any Python frameworks for this assignment.
    Global variables are not permitted.
